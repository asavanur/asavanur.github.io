I consider that I understand an equation when I can predict the properties of its solutions without solving it.
-Paul Dirac

My purpose on this blog is to explain the results of science and sometimes math in a way that most people can understand, and do so using experimental data and the chronological development of the subject. I believe this is the best way to teach the subject to people. I have some predecessors in this vein, but none of them have really done this in a satisfactory way. Some of them have intuitive explanations (e.g. Mahajan’s book{%sidenote 'One' 'https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-011-the-art-of-insight-in-science-and-engineering-mastering-complexity-fall-2014/pages/online-textbook/'%}, who this blog is closest to in approach). Some of them explain the original problem a theory was invented to solve. Some of them say that the previous theory failed to explain the experimental data. But none of them (neither popular science nor technical books) do all of this and also show the actual data with the predictions (failed or not), or at least I have never seen them do this.
Science and math are best taught as a series of improving solutions to practical and interesting problems related to explaining and predicting the world, and in this way you can show why the subject developed in the way that it did as well as showing what it really is (as well as showing that it is fun and beautiful).

Now, why should we care about intuitive understanding? By understanding in this sense, I mean “able to make an approximate numerical prediction”, not just “explain it in a solely verbal manner.” The first reason is that it shows you have plausibly captured the relevant effects. If your estimate is far off, you haven’t. This is used by physicists when in the process of creating a theory to figure out if it is worthwhile to pursue. If an estimate from your assumptions is far off, it is not worth doing a more complicated calculation at all. In addition, if your theory does not reproduce the correct value in simple cases where you know the answer already, it is untrustworthy in more complicated cases.
Another reason is that it provides a sanity check on our answers. If you put 124x67 into your calculator and you get an answer much different from 10,000 (more than a factor of 10 either way), something is wrong. If you do a complicated calculation (by hand or with a computer), and you don’t know the essential ingredients that go into it, it will be very hard to figure out if or where you have made errors.
A side effect of this intuitive understanding
is that it is easier to explain it to people, because it uses only the bare bones of the real calculation. Much of the time, you don’t even need more than high school math. This does make it slightly more complicated than the average popular science book, but this complication is worth it. Lastly, it provides a way for laymen to check and verify that the result is correct, instead of having to take scientists’ statements on trust.
